# Customer-Churn-Prediction-with-ML-From-EDA-to-CSV-Results

# Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning

A complete end-to-end machine learning project for predicting customer churn, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to generating prediction results in CSV format.

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn. The project demonstrates the entire data science workflow:

1. Data exploration and visualization
2. Feature engineering and preprocessing
3. Model selection and training
4. Hyperparameter tuning
5. Model evaluation
6. Deployment of predictions to CSV

## 🔍 Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Thorough analysis of customer demographics, usage patterns, and behaviors correlated with churn
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outliers, and feature encoding
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features that improve model performance
- **Model Selection**: Implementation and comparison of multiple ML algorithms
- **Model Optimization**: Hyperparameter tuning via cross-validation
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics analysis (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)
- **Result Export**: Automated export of predictions to CSV for business integration

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical operations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip or conda for package management

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Start with the EDA notebook to understand the data:
   ```
   jupyter notebook notebooks/01_EDA.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the sequential notebooks to understand the entire workflow

3. To generate predictions on new data:
   ```python
   from src.data_processing import preprocess_data
   from src.model_training import load_model
   
   # Load and preprocess your data
   new_data = preprocess_data('path/to/your/data.csv')
   
   # Load the trained model
   model = load_model('models/best_model.pkl')
   
   # Generate predictions
   predictions = model.predict(new_data)
   
   # Export to CSV
   new_data['churn_prediction'] = predictions
   new_data.to_csv('data/results/predictions.csv', index=False)
   ```

## 📊 Results

The project achieves:
- **Accuracy**: 85%+ on test data
- **AUC-ROC**: 0.90+
- **Key Findings**: [Summary of the most important factors affecting churn]

## 🔮 Future Improvements
